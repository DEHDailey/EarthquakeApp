EarthquakeApp
=============

This GitHub repository contains the UI and Server code files for the Shiny app hosted at [http://dehdailey.shinyapps.io/EarthquakeApp/].
The Shiny app accesses a file containing earthquake data from the USGS site, then displays information from that data file based on user selections.

The reproducible pitch for this application is published on RPubs at [http://rpubs.com/DEHDailey/26155].
